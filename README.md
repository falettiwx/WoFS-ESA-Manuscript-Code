# WoFS-ESA-Manuscript-Code

Python code to reproduce figures in Faletti et al. (2026) study on ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA) in the NOAA Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS).

Limited quantities of smaller data (sensitivity and MRMS files) can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L42uXyyU3-s1BPaUs0zh5f9Yo0lqrgE6?usp=drive_link). 

_Accompanying WoFS forecast data are currently stored at the Texas Tech University High-Performance Computing Center (TTU HPCC) and are available upon request. For data requests, please contact Billy Faletti at william.faletti@noaa.gov._
